              achieved on two real-world core network models. The resulting
              savings are similar for both networks and are very promising.",

  abstract = "Like many studies before it, the Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs Metro
              Network Traffic Growth Study provides evidence of an upward trend
              in IP traffic growth. However, this study is unique in that it
              takes the extra step to analyze the impact of that traffic growth
              on metro and backbone networks. The study analyzes the impact of
              the largest drivers on traffic growth: IP video content and data
              center proliferation within metro networks. The key take- away
              from this study is that metro networks face many changing
              dynamics that will impact the architecture and design of metro
              networks. Alcatel-Lucent understands the evolutionary phase that
              metro networks are currently in and offers a Cloud-Optimized
              Metro solution which delivers agility, scale and efficiency to
              meet growing traffic demand and the requirements of

  author    = "Weldon, Marcus K and Zane, Francis",
  abstract  = "In this paper, we examine broadband access networks based on
               very high bandwidth digital subscriber line (VDSL), passive
               optical network (PON), and active optical network (AON)
               technologies, and discuss the cost and performance tradeoffs of
               these technologies as a function of the critical network
               parameters (e.g., dedicated user bandwidth, population density,
               and subscription rate). We estimate the potential bandwidth
               needs, both current and future, and detail the critical costs
               involved in constructing an access network to serve those needs,
               using a simple generic model of the relative economics of the
               different broadband access technologies. We explicitly include
               trenching, cabling, equipment, and housing costs at all points
               in the network, from the customer premises to the metropolitan
               area network (MAN) node. We show that there is a critical
               downstream bandwidth of approximately 26 Mb/s per subscriber,
               above which the limited reach of digital subscriber line (xDSL)
               makes it less cost-effective to deploy than fiber to the home
               (FTTH), when all network costs are explicitly accounted for. We
               also show that, when near-symmetric upstream bandwidth is
               required, the argument for deploying FTTH networks (either
               active or passive) becomes compelling. © 2003 Lucent
