              for an IP over optical network, which builds on existing planning

              considers the real impact of the IP layer topology change, given
              the actual behavior of the IP layer, leveraging a commercial IP
              planning tool. We then consider the design and cost impact of
              several multi-layer restoration schemes. We compute the savings
              achieved on two real-world core network models. The resulting
              savings are similar for both networks and are very promising.",

  abstract = "Like many studies before it, the Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs Metro
              Network Traffic Growth Study provides evidence of an upward trend
              in IP traffic growth. However, this study is unique in that it
              takes the extra step to analyze the impact of that traffic growth
              on metro and backbone networks. The study analyzes the impact of
              the largest drivers on traffic growth: IP video content and data
              center proliferation within metro networks. The key take- away
              from this study is that metro networks face many changing
              dynamics that will impact the architecture and design of metro
              networks. Alcatel-Lucent understands the evolutionary phase that
              metro networks are currently in and offers a Cloud-Optimized
              Metro solution which delivers agility, scale and efficiency to
              meet growing traffic demand and the requirements of
              application-driven, on-demand cloud services.",
